LazyFlickrGo
============

Because of more photos need to share, but no time to do that. OK, write some code for sharing photos.

Completed:
- AuthGetFrob (`flickr.auth.getFrob`)
- AuthGetToken (`flickr.auth.getToken`)
- GroupsPoolsAdd (`flickr.groups.pools.add`)
- PhotosSearch (`flickr.photos.search`)
- PhotosetsGetPhotos (`flickr.photosets.getPhotos`)

Environment vars *(some vars just for testing)*:
- `FLICKRAPIKEY` *(Get from [Apps.Create](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/))*
- `FLICKRSECRET` *(Get from [Apps.Create](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/))*
- `FLICKRUSERTOKEN` *(Get from user auth `AuthGetFrob`, `AuthGetToken`)*
- `FLICKRUSER` *(Only for testing)*
- `FLICKRGROUPID` *(Only for testing)*
- `FLICKRPHOTOID` *(Only for testing)*

... and still in development.
